The Serverless Research Kit (SRK)
=======================================
The Serverless Research Kit (SRK) exists to accelerate research progress in serverless computing.
It aims to make it easy to innovate on services typically offered by cloud providers by including, for example,
readily hackable versions of cloud functions or cloud object storage. SRK also plans to include common benchmarks
and operational tools, so that launching and evaluating a multi-tenant serverless service is quick and easy.

.. Note:: This documentation focuses on general usage and configuration for SRK. For detailed API documentation, check out our `GoDoc Pages <https://godoc.org/github.com/serverlessresearch/srk>`_.
