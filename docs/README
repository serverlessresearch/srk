# SRK Documentation
The SRK documentation is built using the [sphinx documentation
system](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). Sphinx uses the restructured
text mardown format for all documentation with a number of additional features.  

The main output of sphinx is an HTML representation of your documentation,
although it can be configured to output to other formats (like latex or pdf).
The html output is especially useful when combined with the readthedocs service
which hosts documentation for open source projects.

## Quickstart
First, install the python dependencies. E.g.:
  pip install -r python-requirements.txt

Next, you can build documentation and launch a local web server to see it locally:
  make html
  make server

If you are working on a remote machine, you might want to ssh with ports
forwarded to see the output locally:
  ssh -L 8000:localhost:8000 REMOTEHOST

You can now see the docs by navigating to http://localhost:8000/ in your browser.
